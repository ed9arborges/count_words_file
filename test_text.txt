Test Questions

Please answer the questions below. The test will be timed.

Consider the following two tables:

What is the result set returned by the following query:
select * from T1,T2 where C2=C4

What is the result set return!ed by the following query:
select * from T1 right outer join T2 on (C2=C4)

If it is not clear the tables would be generated by the following script:

INSERT into T1 (c1, c2) values(ʻAʼ,1),(ʻBʼ,2),(ʻCʼ,2), (ʻDʼ,2);
INSERT into T2 (c2, c4) values(ʻWʼ, 1), (ʻXʼ, 2), (ʻYʼ, 2),(ʻZʼ, 3);

Write a script that would read in a text ﬁle and produce an alphabetically sorted list of
words with the count of occurrences of each word. For example if you were to
process this test document you would get the following output:
Frameworks

At JB Global we use the Zend Framework, a high quality open-source framework for
developing applications and services in PHP. The framework offers several features
including database abstraction and an MVC architecture. Additionally the framework is
well tested and suffers from relatively few bugs. From a security standpoint having the
open-source community vet the code means that we can be fairly conﬁdent that obvious
security holes -- like SQL injection -- are covered.

Do you ﬁnd frameworks to be a help or a hinderance?  Name some frameworks you have
used, which ones did you prefer and why?
